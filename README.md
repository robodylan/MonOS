# MonOS
A summer research project into operating systems
This project was started a few summers ago and, after a long break, am attempting to polish it up whenever I get a chance

The original summer project featured:
1. Being able to be loaded into real mode using Grub as a bootloader
2. Incredibilty basic low-level "drivers" for input and output
3. The ability to take keyboard input of ASCII characters
4. Reading and navigating a FAT16 filesytem
5. Reading files from a disk
6. Loading a program into memory
7. Pointing the cpu to that program and executing it
